<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies such as computer vision and machine learning algorithms, proved effective in detecting and reporting violations of Covid-19 preventive measures, Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) asserted.

Such monitoring covers physical distancing and wearing of face masks onboard taxis by passengers or drivers.

“AI technologies have been employed to monitor and verify the compliance with the preventive measures undertaken to limit the spread of the coronavirus. The technology can also report offences such as the failure to observe physical distancing, and the improper wearing of face masks, thanks to video analysis feature,” said Ahmed Mahboub, executive director of smart services, corporate technology support services sector, RTA.

“The use of AI technologies achieved a success rate of 100%. The introduction of this technology was on a trial base, and according to the deliverables, the technology will be generalised to all fleet vehicles,” Mahboub said.

AI devices were programmed to scan human faces and verify if the mask is worn correctly.
